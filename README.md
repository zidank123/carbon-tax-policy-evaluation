# Carbon Tax and Gasoline Consumption in Quebec

**Overview:**

This repository contains the analysis and supporting materials for an empirical paper examining the impact of Quebec’s carbon tax on gasoline consumption. Using monthly per-capita gasoline consumption data, the study evaluates whether the introduction of the tax led to a measurable change in fuel demand relative to a suitable counterfactual.

The project applies a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) research design, comparing Quebec to Ontario before and after the introduction of the carbon tax announced and implemented in 2007.

**Research Question:**

Did the introduction of Quebec’s carbon tax reduce per-capita gasoline consumption relative to Ontario?

This question is relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of market-based environmental policies and for informing future carbon pricing design.

**Data:**

Outcome: Monthly per-capita gasoline consumption

Geography: Quebec (treated) and Ontario (control)

Time period: Long pre- and post-treatment window using monthly data

Source: Statistics Canada

Population-adjusted consumption measures are used to ensure comparability across provinces.

**Empirical Strategy:**

The analysis employs a standard Difference-in-Differences framework:

Quebec is treated following the introduction of the carbon tax

Ontario serves as the control group

The identifying assumption is that, absent the policy, gasoline consumption trends would have evolved similarly across provinces

The model exploits within-province variation over time while controlling for common shocks affecting both provinces.

Robustness checks include alternative specifications and sensitivity to treatment timing.

**Motivation:**

This project reflects my broader interest in applied microeconomics, policy evaluation, and causal inference. While the application is environmental policy, the methods used are directly transferable to decision-making problems in other domains, including sports analytics and performance evaluation.
